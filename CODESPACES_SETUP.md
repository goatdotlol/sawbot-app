# 🚀 GitHub Codespaces Setup Guide

## Why Codespaces?
- ✅ **Zero local build tools needed** (Rust, MSVC, etc. pre-installed)
- ✅ **Total data cost: ~60MB** (vs 5GB+ locally)
- ✅ **Full Tauri performance** (meets all SawBotApp.txt specs)
- ✅ **Free tier: 60 hours/month**
- ✅ **Professional dev environment**

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `drawing-automation-app`
3. Description: "Lightweight drawing automation desktop app with Tauri"
4. Choose **Public** (or Private if you have GitHub Pro)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click **Create repository**

### Step 2: Push Your Local Code

In your local terminal (where you already have the project):

```bash
cd drawing-automation-app

# Initialize git if not already done
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Tauri drawing automation app"

# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/drawing-automation-app.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Open in Codespaces

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/drawing-automation-app`
2. Click the green **"Code"** button (top right)
3. Click **"Codespaces"** tab
4. Click **"Create codespace on main"**
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for setup (everything installs automatically!)

### Step 4: Start Development

Once Codespaces opens (VS Code in browser):

```bash
# Everything is already installed! Just run:
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run tauri dev
```

**That's it!** No build tools to download, no Rust to install - everything works immediately.

## What's Pre-Installed in Codespaces

- ✅ Rust toolchain (latest stable)
- ✅ Cargo package manager
- ✅ Node.js 18+
- ✅ npm/yarn
- ✅ Visual Studio Build Tools (for Windows targets)
- ✅ Git
- ✅ VS Code extensions (Rust, TypeScript, etc.)

## Building for Production

When ready to build the final app:

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

The `.exe` or `.msi` will be in:
```
src-tauri/target/release/bundle/
```

Download only the final installer (~10-15MB) - that's all you need!

## Data Usage Breakdown

- **Codespace setup**: ~50MB (one-time)
- **npm install**: ~300MB (cached in Codespace)
- **Rust dependencies**: ~400MB (cached in Codespace)
- **Final app download**: ~10-15MB
- **Total**: ~60MB vs 5GB+ locally! 🎉

## Tips

1. **Codespaces auto-saves** - Your work is always saved
2. **Free tier**: 60 hours/month (plenty for development)
3. **Can access from any device** - Phone, tablet, another computer
4. **Terminal is full-featured** - Everything works like local dev
5. **Port forwarding** - Tauri dev server works automatically

## Troubleshooting

**Codespace won't start?**
- Check your GitHub account has Codespaces enabled
- Try creating a new codespace
- Free tier might have limits if you've used hours

**Tauri dev not working?**
- Make sure you ran `npm install` first
- Check terminal for errors
- Rust dependencies download automatically on first build

**Need more resources?**
- Upgrade to paid Codespaces plan (if needed)
- Or use local machine after initial setup (build tools already installed)
